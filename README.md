# Step 1: Update Package List
## Open a terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

# Step 2: Install Python and pip
## If Python and pip are not already installed, install them with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
```

# Step 3: Install Jupyter Notebook
## Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

```bash
pip3 install jupyter
```

# Step 4: Start Jupyter Notebook
## Navigate to the directory where your .ipynb file is located, or specify the desired path, then start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
- This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser. You should see your current directory's contents and be able to open .ipynb files from there.

# Step 5: Open and Run Your File
- Locate the file in the Jupyter interface.
- Click on the file to open it.
Use the "Run" button (or press Shift + Enter) to execute cells within the notebook.
